                        <hr>
                        <p> Arguably the most photogenic spot on your whole Bali trip, Kelingking Beach is one of those
                            perspectives that is difficult to trust that it's genuine when you see it surprisingly. This
                            whole beach front territory is especially excellent - the white cliff balance drastically
                            with the turquoise blue waters. This is to a greater extent a perspective than a climb;
                            however it's positively worth making a reroute to see!

                            Stop in a soil parcel with perspectives of the sea, and you can take after an earth way
                            downhill to one side of the stand. There are no signs, and a portion of the guests resting
                            at the stand didn't understand there was a more glorious post right down the way. After
                            around 100 feet, you will abruptly develop at the edge of a precipice that river into thin
                            landmass sticking out into the sea.

                        <hr>
                        <p>Diamond beach is one of the most beautiful beaches on Nusa Penida with towering limestone
                            cliffs and bright turquoise blue water. When exploring Nusa Penida island you can’t miss
                            visiting this beach which is located on the east coast of the island. The viewpoint on
                            Diamond Beach is already picture perfect, but to get down to the beautiful and rugged beach
                            you have to hike along a pretty steep and narrow path with is cut out from the limestone
                            rocks. The hike even involves a little bit of climbing with a rope, but nothing too
                            dangerous to skip it. However if you’re short in time and just want to snap a quick picture
                            of this iconic beach with diamond shaped rocks, then you can easily get to the viewpoint.

                            Nusa Penida that happens to be a cool topographical marvel.

                            On first sight, you'll see a characteristic curve made by the stone bluffs. The curve or the
                            gap in the stone precipice as some would state. The opening in the bluff has likewise
                            permitted sea waters to
                            course through making a ravishing regular pool on the opposite side to wonder about, and
                            even swim.
